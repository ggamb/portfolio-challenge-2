# **Portfolio challenge 2**

## Repository Description

This is my first website entirely from scratch and showcases my HTML and CSS skills as well as the projects I have completed (so far). While the website is a little bare right now and I am clearly not a designer, I will revisit this project to include additional projects and features as I begin to learn JavaScript (and sans pictures of Bill Murray). For now, feel free to click around and be sure to follow me on Github.

## Challenge Reflection

This project has helped me to have a greater understanding and appreciation for HTML and CSS. Prior to this challenge, I had created a website with the help of UT Coding Bootcamp lessons, but was ultimately given the inforamtion I needed to create an entire website. With this challenge, I started entirely from scratch and was left to my own devices to create it all from start to finish. In terms of planning, I created a wireframe sketch and now have an appreciation for planning a website's layout. The wireframe was a great use of my time and led me to understand when and how to use flexboxes. As I worked through the HTML and CSS, I realized where I needed to improve my understanding of the Box Model and began to encounter interesting selectors via MDN Web Docs and W3 Schools -- some of which I included here.
