# portfolio-challenge-2

## Repository Description

This is my first website entirely from scratch and showcases the projects I have completed (so far) and will be updated going forward (sans pictures of Bill Murray). While the base website is a little bare right now, I will revisit this project to include additional features as I begin to learn JavaScript. For now, feel free to click around and be sure to follow me on Github.
